# D'egg (Legacy)
D'egg is a legacy project created while we were game design students of Universidade Anhembi Morumbi as part of our 4th semester evalutation.

<h2> Goals </h2>
<p>
  The game is a 2d vertical scroller where the player is a farmer who should get the maximum amount of eggs that he can while deflecting from obstacles and animals commonly found in the farm.
</p>

<h2> How to play </h2>
<p>
  The player should WASD or the arrow key to move the main character and get the eggs.
